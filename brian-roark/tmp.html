The first ACL Workshop on Computation and Written Language (CAWL) will be held in conjunction with ACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada, on July 13th or 14th 2023 (TBD). It will feature invited talks by Mark Aronoff (Stony Brook University) and Amalia Gnanadesikan (University of Maryland, College Park). <strong>We welcome submissions of scientific papers to be presented at the conference and archived in the ACL Anthology.</strong> Information on submission and format will be posted at <a href="https://cawl.wellformedness.com ">https://cawl.wellformedness.com</a> shortly.<br /><br />

Most work in NLP focuses on language in its canonical written form. This has often led researchers to ignore the differences between written and spoken language or, worse, to conflate the two. Instances of conflation are statements like “Chinese is a logographic language" or “Persian is a right-to-left language", variants of which can be found frequently in the ACL anthology. These statements confuse properties of the language with properties of its writing system. Ignoring differences between written and spoken language leads, among other things, to conflating different words that are spelled the same (e.g., English <em>bass</em>), or treating as different, words that have multiple spellings (e.g., Japanese <em>umai</em> ‘tasty’, which can be written 旨い, うまい, ウマい, or 美味い).<br /><br />

Furthermore, methods for dealing with written language issues (e.g., various kinds of normalization or conversion) or for recognizing text input (e.g. OCR & handwriting recognition or text entry methods) are often regarded as precursors to NLP rather than as fundamental parts of the enterprise, despite the fact that most NLP methods rely centrally on representations derived from text rather than (spoken) language. This general lack of consideration of writing has led to much of the research on such topics to largely appear outside of ACL venues, in conferences or journals of neighboring fields such as speech technology (e.g., text normalization) or human-computer interaction (e.g., text entry).<br /><br />

This workshop will bring together researchers who are interested in the relationship between written and spoken language, the properties of written language, the ways in which writing systems encode language, and applications specifically focused on characteristics of writing systems. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>Text entry</li>
<li>Text tokenization</li>
<li>Disambiguation of abbreviations and homographs</li>
<li>Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, transliteration, and diacritization</li>
<li>Text normalization for speech and for processing "informal" genres of text</li>
<li>Computational study of literary devices involving writing systems, such as eye dialect</li>
<li>Information-theoretic and machine-learning approaches to decipherment</li>
<li>Methods for specialized text genres, e.g., clinical notes</li>
<li>Optical character (incl. handwriting) recognition and historical document processing</li>
<li>Orthographic representation for unwritten languages</li>
<li>Spelling error detection and correction</li>
<li>Script normalization and encoding</li>
<li>Writing system typology and its relevance to speech and language processing</li>
</ul>

We invite submissions on the relationship between written and spoken language, the properties of written language, the ways in which writing systems encode language, and applications specifically focused on characteristics of writing systems.
